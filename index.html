            <p>My name is Etienne, I'm 34 years young and I live in the beautiful town of Sinzig,
                nestled between Bonn and Koblenz. My family brings me the greatest joy. I'm a husband and prouder
                father of three wonderful children.<br><br>

                Since my childhood, I've been fascinated by all sorts of topics related to IT. It all started back in
                the 2000s when I experienced the era of LAN parties. Since then, I've truly immersed myself in the world
                of computers. From tinkering with hardware to solving tricky IT problems. I keep myself busy with the
                latest technological developments and enjoy delving into various software.<br><br>

                In my circle of friends and acquaintances, I'm sort of the "Tech Guru", always on hand to help with
                everyday PC problems or answer technical questions. In both my previous roles as a Managing Director and
                a Production
                Manager, I've consistently driven digitalization forward. My technical understanding and innovative
                spirit have been more in demand than ever when it comes to solving problems and implement
                changes.<br><br>

                Since 2023, I've been deeply engaged in artificial intelligence and voice-controlled systems such as
                ChatGPT. With their help, I've even written a book. Over the years, my desire to further develop myself
                in the direction of my passion, the IT world, has steadily grown. That's why in 2024, I decided to
                pursue further education in software development to steer my career in this direction.</p>
